# SnapJudge – Instantly Evaluate Startup Ideas with AI

SnapJudge is an AI-powered idea evaluation tool that turns screenshots, scribbles, and mockups into instant feasibility scores. Built for hackathons, founders, makers, and product thinkers, SnapJudge uses cutting-edge vision models to analyze an idea and return a clear decision: **Go**, **No-Go**, or **Maybe** — all in a matter of seconds.

It’s your fast, intelligent co-pilot for validating ideas before you build them.

## 🚀 Features

  Upload any screenshot, sketch, wireframe, or landing page. SnapJudge uses advanced multimodal AI to extract meaning, understand context, and evaluate product viability.

- **Feasibility Score (0–100)**  
  Instantly see how realistic the idea is to build, based on complexity, clarity, and scope.

- **Cost & Time Estimates**  
  Receive approximate MVP cost and development timelines to guide early planning.

- **Complexity Assessment**  
  A simple 1–5 scale to understand how challenging the idea might be to implement.

- **Go / No-Go Verdict**

  Built with reusable SwiftUI components and previews to ensure a smooth developer experience and a polished UI.
